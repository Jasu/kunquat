    NOTE:

Kunquat is in a very early development stage. Don't expect it to do anything
useful.


    Dependencies
    ------------

On a relatively new Ubuntu you should be able to get all the required and
optional dependencies by running the following command:

sudo apt-get install build-essential scons libarchive-dev libwavpack-dev libpulse-dev libjack-dev jackd libasound2-dev check libopenal-dev libalut-dev libsndfile1-dev


Building of Kunquat depends on the following tools and libraries (version
numbers indicate tested versions -- older versions may or may not work):

  scons 1.2.0 (http://www.scons.org/)
  libarchive 2.4.17 (http://code.google.com/p/libarchive/)

Normally, you also want Kunquat to support samples. For that, you'll need:

  libwavpack 4.50.1 (http://www.wavpack.com/)

In order to get sound you'll need at least one of the following:

  PulseAudio 0.9.19 (http://pulseaudio.org/)
  JACK 0.116.1 (http://jackaudio.org/)
  OpenAL 1.4.272 (http://www.openal.org/)

If you want to build waveform audio export support, you'll need:

  libsndfile 1.0.20 (http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/)

Additionally, if you want to build the test code, you'll need:

  Check 0.9.5 (http://check.sourceforge.net/)
   

    Building instructions
    ---------------------

To get a list of build options, run:

  scons -h

The build options can be altered in the file "options.py".

To build Kunquat, run:

  scons

To clean the build, run:

  scons -c

This still leaves a couple of SCons-related files behind. If you need a more
thorough clean, run:

  scons -c --full-clean


    Installation instructions
    -------------------------

Make sure you have the required permissions for installing Kunquat into the
directory of your choice. To install Kunquat into the default directory, run:

  scons install

You can change the installation prefix in the file "options.py" or via
command line. For example, to install into /opt, run:

  scons prefix=/opt install

To uninstall Kunquat, run:

  scons -c install

Make sure you use the same prefix as during the installation. You can specify
the uninstallation prefix like this:

  scons prefix=/opt -c install


    Running instructions
    --------------------

To hear the example composition, run (in the same directory as this INSTALL
file):

  kunquat-player examples/example.kqt.bz2

To get more details on how to use kunquat-player, run:

  kunquat-player -h


You can convert the example composition into a .wav file by running:

  kunquat-export examples/example.kqt.bz2

This will create a file called examples/example.wav. To get more information,
run:

  kunquat-export -h
