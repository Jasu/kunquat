On a relatively recent Ubuntu system you should be able to install and try out Kunquat by doing the following:

sudo -k apt-get install build-essential libwavpack-dev libpulse-dev python3-pyside check libsndfile1-dev libsamplerate0
./get_build_support.sh
./make.py
./make.py --prefix=~/kunquat install
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/kunquat/lib
export PYTHONPATH=~/kunquat/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages # replace X.Y with installed Python 3 version
~/kunquat/bin/kunquat-tracker

NOTE: Kunquat is in an early development stage. Don't expect it to do anything useful.
