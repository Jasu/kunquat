	NOTE:

Kunquat is in a very early development stage. Don't expect it to do anything
useful.


	Building instructions
	---------------------

Building of Kunquat depends on the following tools and libraries:

  scons (http://www.scons.org/)
  liblo (http://liblo.sourceforge.net/)
  JACK (http://jackaudio.org/)
  ALSA (http://www.alsa-project.org/)

Additionally, if you're building the test code, you'll need:

  Check (http://check.sourceforge.net/)

On a freshly installed Ubuntu system you should be able to get
all the required stuff by running the following command:
sudo apt-get install build-essential scons liblo0-dev libjack-dev jackd libasound2-dev check


To get a list of build options, run:

  scons -h

The build options can be altered in the file "options.py".

To build Kunquat, run:

  scons

To clean the build, run:

  scons -c


In order to run the user interface you'll also need pyliblo.
You can get it from http://das.nasophon.de/pyliblo/
