    NOTE:

Kunquat is in a very early development stage. Don't expect it to do anything
useful.


    Dependencies
    ------------

Building of Kunquat depends on the following tools and libraries:

  scons (http://www.scons.org/)
  libarchive (http://code.google.com/p/libarchive/)
  libwavpack (http://www.wavpack.com/)

In order to get sound you'll need one of the following:

  JACK (http://jackaudio.org/)
  libao (http://www.xiph.org/ao/)
  OpenAL (http://www.openal.org/)

Additionally, if you're building the test code, you'll need:

  Check (http://check.sourceforge.net/)
   

    Installing the Dependencies
    ---------------------------

Ubuntu:

On a relatively new Ubuntu you should be able to get all the required and
optional dependencies by running the following command:

sudo apt-get install build-essential scons libarchive-dev libwavpack-dev libjack-dev jackd libao-dev libasound2-dev check libgtk2.0-dev libopenal-dev libalut-dev


    Building instructions
    ---------------------

To get a list of build options, run:

  scons -h

The build options can be altered in the file "options.py".

To build Kunquat, run:

  scons

To clean the build, run:

  scons -c

This still leaves a couple of SCons-related files behind. If you need a more
thorough clean, run:

  scons -c --full-clean


    Running instructions
    --------------------

To hear the example composition, run:

  src/player/kunquat-player examples/example.kqt.bz2

To get more details on how to use kunquat-player, run:

  src/player/kunquat-player -h
