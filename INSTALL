    NOTE:

Kunquat is in a very early development stage. Don't expect it to do anything
useful.


    Dependencies
    ------------

On a relatively new Ubuntu you should be able to get all the required and
optional dependencies by running the following command:

sudo apt-get install build-essential scons libarchive-dev libwavpack-dev libpulse-dev libjack-dev jackd libasound2-dev check libopenal-dev libalut-dev libsndfile1-dev


Building of Kunquat depends on the following tools and libraries (version
numbers indicate tested versions -- older versions may or may not work):

  scons 1.2.0 (http://www.scons.org/)
  libarchive 2.4.17 (http://code.google.com/p/libarchive/)

Normally, you also want Kunquat to support samples. For that, you'll need:

  libwavpack 4.50.1 (http://www.wavpack.com/)

In order to get sound you'll need at least one of the following:

  PulseAudio 0.9.19 (http://pulseaudio.org/)
  JACK 0.116.1 (http://jackaudio.org/)
  OpenAL 1.4.272 (http://www.openal.org/)

If you want to build waveform audio export support, you'll need:

  libsndfile 1.0.20 (http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/)

Additionally, if you want to build the test code, you'll need:

  Check 0.9.5 (http://check.sourceforge.net/)
   

    Building instructions
    ---------------------

To get a list of build options, run:

  scons -h

The build options can be altered in the file "options.py".

To build Kunquat, run:

  scons

To clean the build, run:

  scons -c

This still leaves a couple of SCons-related files behind. If you need a more
thorough clean, run:

  scons -c --full-clean


    Installation instructions
    -------------------------

Make sure you have the required permissions for installing Kunquat into the
directory of your choice. To install Kunquat into, for example,
"/opt/kunquat", run:

  scons prefix=/opt/kunquat install
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/kunquat/lib

To unistall Kunquat, run (make sure you use the same prefix as during the
installation):

  scons prefix=/opt/kunquat -c install

If the prefix argument is omitted, the installation prefix specified in the
file "options.py" will be used.


    Running instructions
    --------------------

To hear the example composition, run:

  /opt/kunquat/bin/kunquat-player /opt/kunquat/share/doc/kunquat/examples/example.kqt.bz2

To get more details on how to use kunquat-player, run:

  /opt/kunquat/bin/kunquat-player -h


You can convert the example composition into a .wav file by running:

  /opt/kunquat/bin/kunquat-export -o out.wav /opt/kunquat/share/doc/kunquat/examples/example.kqt.bz2

This will create a file called out.wav into the current working directory.
To get more information about kunquat-export, run:

  /opt/kunquat/bin/kunquat-export -h
