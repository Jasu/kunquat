On a relatively recent Ubuntu system you should be able to install and try out Kunquat by doing the following:

sudo -k apt-get install build-essential scons libwavpack-dev libpulse-dev python-qt4 check libsndfile1-dev
./get_build_support.sh
./make.py
./make.py --prefix=~/kunquat install
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/kunquat/lib
export PYTHONPATH=~/kunquat/lib/python2.7/site-packages
~/kunquat/bin/kunquat-tracker

NOTE: Kunquat is in an early development stage. Don't expect it to do anything useful.
