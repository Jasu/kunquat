/**
 * \defgroup Player Playing Kunquat compositions
 *
 * \{
 *
 * \brief
 * This module describes a simple API for applications that use libkunquat
 * for playing Kunquat compositions.
 *
 * After the Kunquat Handle has been created, the user can get the audio to
 * be played in short sections. First the user mixes a short section of music
 * into internal buffers and then transfers the necessary information from the
 * internal buffers into its own output buffers. This process is repeated as
 * many times as needed. The basic playback cycle might look like this:
 *
 * \code
 * long buffer_size = kqt_Handle_get_buffer_size(handle);
 * long mixed = 0;
 * while ((mixed = kqt_Handle_mix(handle, buffer_size)) > 0)
 * {
 *     float* buffers[KQT_BUFFERS_MAX] = { NULL };
 *     buffers[0] = kqt_Handle_get_buffer(handle, 0); // left
 *     buffers[1] = kqt_Handle_get_buffer(handle, 1); // right
 *     // Convert (if necessary) and store the contents of the
 *     // buffers into the output buffers of the program,
 *     // then play the contents of the output buffers.
 *     // The number of frames per buffer is stored in the variable mixed.
 * }
 * \endcode
 */


/**
 * Mixes audio according to the state of the Kunquat Handle.
 *
 * \param handle    The Handle -- should not be \c NULL.
 * \param nframes   The number of frames to be mixed -- should be > \c 0.
 *
 * \return   The number of frames actually mixed. This is always
 *           <= \a nframes and <= kqt_Handle_get_buffer_size(handle).

/**
 * Gets a mixing buffer from the Kunquat Handle.
 *
 * When called after a successful call of kqt_Handle_mix, this function
 * returns a portion of mixed audio of one output channel. The parameter
 * \a index determines the output channel.
 *
 * \param handle   The Handle -- should not be \c NULL.
 * \param index    The output channel number. \c 0 is the left

 *
 * \return   The buffer, or \c NULL if \a handle is not valid or \a index
 *           is out of range.
 *           The buffer contains sample values normalised to the range
 *           [-1.0, 1.0]. However, values beyond this range are possible
 *           and they indicate clipping.
 *           Note: Do not cache the returned value! The location of the buffer
 *           may change in memory, especially if the buffer size is changed.

 * \return   \c 1 if successful, or \c 0 if memory allocation failed. Memory
 *           allocation failure is possible if the composition uses features

/**
 * Sets the buffer size of the Kunquat Handle.
 *
 * The buffer size determines the maximum amount of audio data that can
 * be mixed at one time. The buffer size is given as the number of amplitude
 * values (called \a frames) for one output channel. In a typical case, the
 * calling application should set this value based on the size of its own
 * output buffers: if the application uses buffers with \a n amplitude values
 * for one output channel (e.g. in 16-bit stereo, this takes \a n * \c 4 bytes
 * in total), it should call kqt_new_Handle with a buffer size of \a n.
 *
 * \param handle   The Handle -- should not be \c NULL.
 * \param size     The new buffer size -- should be > \c 0 and
 *                 <= \c KQT_BUFFER_SIZE_MAX. The upper limit is a safety
 *                 measure -- typically, implementations use a buffer size of
 *                 no more than a couple of thousand frames.
 *
 * \return   \c 1 if successful, otherwise \c 0.
 *           Note: If memory allocation fails, mixing is still possible but
 *           only with min{old_size, new_size} frames at a time. However, it
 *           may be a good idea to just give up in this case.
