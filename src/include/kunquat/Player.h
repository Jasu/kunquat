 *
 * \{
 *
 * \brief
 * This module describes a simple API for applications that use libkunquat
 * for playing Kunquat compositions.
 *
 * After the Kunquat Handle has been created, the user can get the audio to
 * be played in short sections. First the user mixes a short section of music
 * into internal buffers and then transfers the necessary information from the
 * internal buffers into its own output buffers. This process is repeated as
 * many times as needed. The basic playback cycle might look like this:
 *
 * \code
 * int buffer_count = kqt_Handle_get_buffer_count(handle);
 * long buffer_size = kqt_Handle_get_buffer_size(handle);
 * long mixed = 0;
 * while ((mixed = kqt_Handle_mix(handle, buffer_size, 48000)) > 0)
 * {
 *     kqt_frame* buffers[KQT_BUFFERS_MAX] = { NULL };
 *     for (int i = 0; i < buffer_count; ++i)
 *     {
 *         buffers[i] = kqt_Handle_get_buffer(handle, i);
 *     }
 *     // convert (if necessary) and store the contents of the
 *     // buffers into the output buffers of the program,
 *     // then play the contents of the output buffers
 * }
 * \endcode

/**
