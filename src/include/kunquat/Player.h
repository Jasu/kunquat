 *
 * \{
 *
 * \brief
 * This module describes a simple API for applications that use libkunquat
 * for playing Kunquat compositions.
 *
 * After the Kunquat Handle has been created, the user can get the audio to
 * be played in short sections. First the user mixes a short section of music
 * into internal buffers and then transfers the necessary information from the
 * internal buffers into its own output buffers. This process is repeated as
 * many times as needed. The basic playback cycle might look like this:
 *
 * \code
 * int buffer_count = kqt_Handle_get_buffer_count(handle);
 * long buffer_size = kqt_Handle_get_buffer_size(handle);
 * long mixed = 0;
 * while ((mixed = kqt_Handle_mix(handle, buffer_size, 48000)) > 0)
 * {
 *     kqt_frame* buffers[KQT_BUFFERS_MAX] = { NULL };
 *     for (int i = 0; i < buffer_count; ++i)
 *     {
 *         buffers[i] = kqt_Handle_get_buffer(handle, i);
 *     }
 *     // convert (if necessary) and store the contents of the
 *     // buffers into the output buffers of the program,
 *     // then play the contents of the output buffers
 * }
 * \endcode
 */


/**
 * Mixes audio according to the state of the Kunquat Handle.
 *
 * \param handle    The Handle -- should not be \c NULL.
 * \param nframes   The number of frames to be mixed.
 * \param freq      The mixing frequency in frames per second
 *                  -- should be > \c 0. Typical values are
 *                  44100 ("CD quality") and 48000.

/**
 * Gets a mixing buffer from the Kunquat Handle.
 *
 * When called after a successful call of kqt_Handle_mix, this function
 * returns a portion of mixed audio of one output channel. The parameter
 * \a index determines the channel.
 *
 * \param handle   The Handle -- should not be \c NULL.
 * \param index    The output channel number. \c 0 is the left
 *                 mixing buffer and \c 1 is the right one.
 *
 * \return   The buffer, or \c NULL if \a handle == \c NULL or \a index
 *           is out of range.
 *           The buffer contains sample values normalised to the range
 *           [-1.0, 1.0]. However, values beyond this range are possible
 *           and they indicate clipping.
 *           Note: Do not cache the returned value! The location of the buffer
 *           may change in memory, especially if the buffer size or the number
 *           of buffers is changed.

 * \param size     The new buffer size -- should be > \c 0.

 *           may be a good idea to just give up in this case.
