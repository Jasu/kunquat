.SH NAME

Kunquat Handle interface

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B #include <kunquat/Handle.h>

.BI "kqt_Handle* kqt_new_Handle(void);

.BI "int kqt_Handle_set_data(kqt_Handle* " handle ", char* " key ", void* " data ", long " length );

.BI "char* kqt_Handle_get_error(kqt_Handle* " handle );
.br
.BI "void kqt_Handle_clear_error(kqt_Handle* " handle );

.BI "void kqt_del_Handle(kqt_Handle* " handle );

.SH "KUNQUAT HANDLE"

The \fBkqt_Handle\fR is an opaque data structure that represents a Kunquat
composition in memory.
A Kunquat composition file (usually
with a file extension "kqt", possibly succeeded by an extension indicating
compression format) is a single file suitable for distribution.
Currently, the Kunquat library does not provide convenient access to these files.

Operations on Kunquat Handles are generally \fInot\fR thread-safe. In
particular, multiple threads must not create or destroy Kunquat Handles or
access a single Kunquat Handle in parallel. However, accessing different
Kunquat Handles from different threads in parallel should be safe.

.SH "CREATING KUNQUAT HANDLES"

.IP "\fBkqt_Handle* kqt_new_Handle(void);\fR"
Creates a new Kunquat Handle that contains an empty composition.
The function returns the new Kunquat Handle on success, or NULL if
an error occurred.

.SH "DATA MODIFICATION"

Composition data can be modified through a Kunquat Handle with keys. A valid
key consists of one or more textual elements separated by forward slashes
('/'). The last element is the only one that is allowed and required to
contain a period. The format is similar, but not equivalent, to that of POSIX
directory paths. Examples:

.in +4n
.nf
p_composition.json
pat_000/col_00/p_channel_events.json
ins_01/p_instrument.json
.fi
.in

.IP "\fBint kqt_Handle_set_data(kqt_Handle*\fR \fIhandle\fR\fB, char*\fR \fIkey\fR\fB, void*\fR \fIdata\fR\fB, long\fR \fIlength\fR\fB);\fR"
Sets data in \fIhandle\fR associated with \fIkey\fR. The \fIlength\fR argument
specifies the number of bytes in \fIdata\fR and must not exceed the real
length of \fIdata\fR. If \fIlength\fR is 0, the data associated with \fIkey\fR
is removed. If \fIkey\fR affects the way the music is mixed, \fIdata\fR is
validated before setting. Otherwise, no checking is performed -- this is done
to allow future extensions. This function returns 1 on success, 0 on failure.

.SH ERRORS

Errors in Kunquat are divided into the following categories:

.IP \fBArgumentError\fR
A Kunquat function was called with an inappropriate argument value. Usually,
this indicates an error in the calling or the library code.

.IP \fBFormatError\fR
An input file or value to be stored was invalid.

.IP \fBMemoryError\fR
Memory allocation failed. If this happens with a function that modifies
composition data, the data may be corrupted.

.IP \fBResourceError\fR
The Kunquat library could not get service from an external resource such as
another library or the file system.

.PP
Error messages are JSON object strings that contain at least two keys: "type"
and "message". The value of "type" is one of the categories above and the
value of "message" is a human-readable description of the error.

.IP "\fBchar* kqt_Handle_get_error(kqt_Handle*\fR \fIhandle\fR\fB);\fR"
Returns an error message describing the last error occurred when accessing
\fIhandle\fR. \fIhandle\fR may also be NULL, in which case the function
returns an error message about the last error occurred in using the Kunquat
library in general. In particular, passing NULL as the argument is the only
way to retrieve Handle creation error messages. The function will return the
last error message, or an empty string if no error has occurred.

.IP "\fBvoid kqt_Handle_clear_error(kqt_Handle*\fR \fIhandle\fR\fB);\fR"
Clears error information in \fIhandle\fR. This is useful to do before calling
a function for which the only way to detect an error is via
\fBkqt_Handle_get_error\fR.
\fIhandle\fR may also be NULL, in which case the generic error message is
cleared.

.SH "FREEING RESOURCES"

.IP "\fBvoid kqt_del_Handle(kqt_Handle*\fR \fIhandle\fR\fB);\fR"
Destroys \fIhandle\fR and all resources allocated for it. Note that the data
returned by calls of \fBkqt_Handle_get_data\fR with this handle is also freed
here in case it wasn't freed before through \fBkqt_Handle_free_data\fR. The
function \fBkqt_del_Handle\fR does not return a value, and it only sets the
generic error message in case \fIhandle\fR is invalid.
