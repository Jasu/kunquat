 * \brief
 * This module describes Kunquat Handle, the main identifier for accessing
 * Kunquat compositions.
 *
 * Every Kunquat composition is accessed through a Kunquat Handle which has
 * the type kqt_Handle. The user needs to create a Kunquat Handle first, then
 * operate the Handle in order to play and/or modify the composition, and
 * finally release the allocated resources by destroying the Handle.
 *
 * An API for simple playback functionality is located in \c Player.h.
 */


/**
 * The identifier for accessing a single Kunquat composition.
 *
 * All functions that operate on Kunquat Handles may set an error message
 * inside the Handle. See kqt_Handle_get_error for more information.
 *
 * Operations on Kunquat Handles are generally <b>not</b> thread-safe. In
 * particular, multiple threads must not create new Kunquat Handles or access
 * a single Kunquat Handle in parallel. However, accessing different Kunquat
 * Handles from different threads in parallel should be safe.

 * values (called \a frames) for one output channel. In a typical case, the
