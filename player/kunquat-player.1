.SH DESCRIPTION
.B kunquat\-player
is a command\-line player for playing Kunquat compositions. It supports
both .kqt files (optionally compressed with \fBgzip\fR(1) or \fBbzip2\fR(1))
and unpacked Kunquat composition directories (these are named kqtc\fIXX\fR
where \fIXX\fR is the version number of the format).

sound is limited to \fIn\fR/2 Hz. \fIn\fR is a value between 1000 and 192000.

.IP "\fB\-s\fR \fIsub\fR, \fB\-\-subsong\fR \fIsub\fR"
Plays the subsong \fIsub\fR. \fIsub\fR is a value between 0 and 255 or
