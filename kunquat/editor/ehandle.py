        Arguments:
        path -- The path to the Kunquat composition project directory.
                Normally, this directory contains the subdirectories
                "committed" and "workspace", although new project
                directories may be empty.

        Optional arguments:
        mixing_rate -- Mixing rate in frames per second.  Typical
                       values include 44100 ("CD quality") and 48000

        key -- The key of the data in the composition.  A key consists
               of one or more textual elements separated by forward
               slashes ('/').  The last element is the only one that
               is allowed and required to contain a period.  Examples:
               'p_composition.json'
               'pat_000/col_00/p_events.json'

               number behind the scenes.

        Return value:
        The data associated with the key if found, otherwise None.
        The function converts JSON data to Python objects.

        If any exception is raised during the commit, it is usually a

        restore a valid composition state.  Changes made after the last
        successful commit are possibly lost in this case, though.
